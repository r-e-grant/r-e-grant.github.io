API Technical Writer

## **Summary**

1\) 20 Years’ Experience as a Microsoft Employee in Software and Technical Documentation.  
2\) 5 Years Technical and Software Business Consulting.  
3\) Proven day-to-day experience composing, writing, and editing technical documentation and training materials across software and technology domains.  

At Microsoft Corporation, from 2002 to 2016, I worked as an employee in Developer Education and API Documentation (after advancing up the Test-Developer track). 

Since 2016 I have used my expertise to help small and developing software businesses in Mexico break into the US market, including refactoring and migrate content from an unstructured knowledge base to a structured DITA XML, CCMS.

I have a range of business experience outside of API/Technical Documentation, so I understand its cross-functional context when consumed by Product, Marketing, Engineering and Leadership team audiences. 

I am a US citizen with legal and tax residence in Washington State for 1099/W-2. 
I have an unrestricted Permanent Residence Work Visa while in Mexico. 
I do remote work in the USA and public service volunteering in Oaxaca, Mexico. 
Preferred US bases for remote or hybrid work are California (Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties) and Dallas, TX.
Relocation negotiable for on-site work.
