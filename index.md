## Summary

**1\)**  20 Years’ Experience as a Microsoft Employee in Software Engineering and Technical Documentation.  
**2\)**  5 Years Technical and Software Business Consulting.  
**3\)**  Proven day-to-day experience composing, writing, and editing technical documentation and training materials across software and technology domains.  

At Microsoft Corporation, from 2002 to 2016, I worked as an employee in Developer Education and API Documentation (after advancing up the Test-Developer track). 

Since 2016 I have used my expertise to help small and developing software businesses in Mexico break into the US market, including refactoring and migrating content from ad-hoc depositories to best-practices USA standards (GitHub, Structured DITA XML CCM systems, Panda, Confluence).

I have a range of business experience outside of API/Technical Documentation, so I understand its cross-functional context when consumed by Product, Marketing, Engineering and Leadership team audiences. 

I am a US citizen with legal and tax residence in Washington State for 1099 or W-2 work.<br>

I have an unrestricted Permanent Residence Work Visa while in Mexico.<br>

I do remote work in the USA and Mexico.<br>

I do public service volunteering in Oaxaca, Mexico.<br>

Relocation negotiable for on-site work.<br>
